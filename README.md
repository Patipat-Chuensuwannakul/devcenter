DataStax DevCenter is a free visual query tool for developers and administrators 
for creating and running Cassandra Query Language (CQL) queries and commands 
against Apache Cassandraâ„¢ and DataStax Enterprise.


## Installing/Running

After unpacking the downloaded archive, you'll find a platform specific executable 
(`DevCenter.exe` or `DevCenter.app`) in the `devcenter` folder. Simply run the executable to launch DevCenter.

_Note_: even if packaged as a self-contained Eclipse RCP-based app, DevCenter requires that java be installed on your system and present in your application path.

## Connecting to a Cassandra or DSE cluster

To configure a connection to a Cassandra cluster, use the top left Connections panel. 
Enter a name for the connection and the IP(s) of the Cassandra node(s) to connect to. 
If the cluster requires authentication, the wizard also allows entering the username and password. The wizard also allows enabling SSL connections.

_Note_: In case DevCenter is not able to connect to the Cassandra cluster please check these 
[connection requirements](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver/wiki/Connection-requirements).
 

## Running CQL scripts
 
Enter CQL commands in a DevCenter query editor/panel, select a configured connection and press the Run button. 
DevCenter uses a tabbed interface that allows you to have multiple query editors open at the same time. 
Simply click on the New SQL Script button in the CQL Scripts pane to create additional query editors.

## FAQ

Q: **Why does DevCenter on Mac OS/X need Java 6?**

A: When launching DevCenter on Mac OS/X, you might see an error message stating: "To open 'DevCenter' you need to install the legacy Java SE 6 runtime.  Click 'More Info...' to visit the legacy Java SE 6 download website". Although DevCenter is compatible with any recent Java version, Mac OS/X might force you to use Java 6. If this happens, simply follow the link in the message and install Java 6.

Q: **Why am I seeing the â€œFailed to load the JNI shared library" error when starting DevCenter?**

A: It's likely to be because you're using a 32bits app on a 64bits jvm or conversely. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7352493/failed-to-load-the-jni-shared-library-jdk for more details.

Q: **Why aren't all my database objects showing up in the auto-completion popup?**

A: To retrieve an up to date view of the database schema, DevCenter requires an active connection to the cluster, so if you are working offline, only the database objects defined in the
current script will be available for auto-completion.

Q: **Why isn't the Detailed Results View updated when a new Results table cell is selected?**

A: This is a known issue using VNC Viewer to connect to a virtual machine running DevCenter. Connecting using the VMWare console does not have this problem.

Q: **Is there any way to disable Query Tracing?**

A: By default, DevCenter enables query tracing only for the last query executed in a script. A system property can be used to control this by adding the following like to the DevCenter `config.ini` file:
`devcenter.querytrace.enabled=false`

The `config.ini` file is located in:

- Mac: `<DevCenter_Home>/configuration`
- Linux: `<DevCenter_Home>/configuration`
- Windows: `<DevCenter_Home>/configuration`

Q: **Does DevCenter allow connection to a DSE cluster configured with LDAP authentication?**

A: Yes, DevCenter has been tested to be able to connect to a DSE cluster configured with OpenLDAP, OracleLDAP, WinAD08 and WinAD12.

Q: **I just got "an internal error occurred during Xtext validation. Java heap space" dialog. What can I do about it?**

A: Increase the JVM MaxHeapSize by adding `-Xmx512m` or `-Xmx1024m` to the `DevCenter.ini` file The `DevCenter.ini` file is located in:

- Mac: `<DevCenter_Home>/DevCenter.app/Contents/MacOS`
- Linux: `<DevCenter_Home>`
- Windows: `<DevCenter_Home>`
